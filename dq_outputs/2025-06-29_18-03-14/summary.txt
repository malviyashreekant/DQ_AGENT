It looks like you have a large list of rows with identical column names and the same data type for all columns.

The issue seems to be that the date format is not being recognized as a standard date format by your software or database. This could be due to various reasons such as:

* The date format is not in a standard format (e.g., DD/MM/YYYY, MM/DD/YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD)
* There are extra characters in the dates (e.g., commas, spaces, etc.)
* The dates are being stored in a different data type than expected (e.g., string instead of datetime)

To resolve this issue, you can try one or more of the following steps:

1. **Verify the date format**: Check if the dates are in a standard format and confirm that they should be recognized by your software or database.
2. **Use a specific date format**: Try using a specific date format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD) to ensure consistency.
3. **Strip extra characters**: Remove any extra characters from the dates (e.g., commas, spaces).
4. **Check data type**: Verify that the dates are being stored in the correct data type (e.g., datetime instead of string).

If you're using a database, you can try using the `strftime` or `parse_date` functions to format the dates correctly.

Here's an example:
```sql
SELECT 
  -- Assume this is your date column
  strftime('%Y-%m-%d', '2022-07-25') AS formatted_date
FROM your_table;
```
If you're using a software that doesn't support specific date formats, you can try using a standard format like YYYY-MM-DD or MM/DD/YYYY.
